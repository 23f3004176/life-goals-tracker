## Style Guides

### Git Commit Messages

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

- **feat:** A new feature
- **fix:** A bug fix
- **docs:** Documentation only changes
- **style:** Changes that don't affect the meaning of the code (formatting, etc.)
- **refactor:** A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf:** A code change that improves performance
- **test:** Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **chore:** Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

**Examples:**
```
feat: add goal category filtering
fix: resolve authentication timeout issue
docs: update installation instructions
style: format code with Prettier
refactor: simplify goal creation logic
perf: optimize database queries
test: add tests for user authentication
chore: update dependencies
```

### JavaScript Style Guide

- Use **ES6+** syntax
- Use **functional components** with hooks for React
- Use **arrow functions** for consistency
- Use **const** and **let** instead of **var**
- Use **meaningful variable names**
- Add **comments** for complex logic
- Keep functions **small and focused**
- Follow **DRY principle** (Don't Repeat Yourself)

**Example:**
```javascript
// Good
const calculateProgress = (completed, total) => {
  return (completed / total) * 100;
};

// Bad
function calc(c, t) {
  return c / t * 100;
}
```

### CSS Style Guide

- Use **BEM naming convention** or **CSS modules**
- Use **mobile-first** approach
- Group related properties together
- Use **meaningful class names**
- Avoid **!important** unless absolutely necessary
- Use **CSS variables** for colors and common values

**Example:**
```css
/* Good */
.goal-card {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  padding: 1rem;
  background-color: var(--card-bg);
  border-radius: 8px;
}

/* Bad */
.gc {
  display: flex !important;
  padding: 16px;
  background: #fff;
}
```

## Development Setup

1. **Clone your fork**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/life-goals-tracker.git
   cd life-goals-tracker
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Firebase**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory
   - Add your Firebase configuration
   ```env
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
   ```

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. **Open your browser**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## Testing

Before submitting your pull request, make sure all tests pass:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm test -- --watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm test -- --coverage
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for new features
- Update tests for modified features
- Aim for high test coverage
- Test edge cases and error scenarios

**Example:**
```javascript
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import GoalCard from './GoalCard';

test('renders goal title', () => {
  const goal = { title: 'Learn React', progress: 50 };
  render(<GoalCard goal={goal} />);
  expect(screen.getByText('Learn React')).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```
